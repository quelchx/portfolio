## Simple Glow Effect

While watching some YouTube shorts I came across a cool glow effect that I wanted to recreate using CSS. The effect was simple yet eye-catching, and I thought it would be a fun project to work on.

Here's a breakdown of how I created the glow effect:

### Assumptions

I assume you have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. If you're new to web development, I recommend checking out some beginner tutorials to get started.
Lets assume you have an anchor tag with the class name `glow` with an icon inside.

```html
<a href="#" class="glow">
  <!-- github icon -->
  <svg
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    width="1em"
    height="1em"
    viewBox="0 0 1024 1024"
  >
    <path
      fill="currentColor"
      d="M511.6 76.3C264.3 76.2 64 276.4 64 523.5C64 718.9 189.3 885 363.8 946c23.5 5.9 19.9-10.8 19.9-22.2v-77.5c-135.7 15.9-141.2-73.9-150.3-88.9C215 726 171.5 718 184.5 703c30.9-15.9 62.4 4 98.9 57.9c26.4 39.1 77.9 32.5 104 26c5.7-23.5 17.9-44.5 34.7-60.8c-140.6-25.2-199.2-111-199.2-213c0-49.5 16.3-95 48.3-131.7c-20.4-60.5 1.9-112.3 4.9-120c58.1-5.2 118.5 41.6 123.2 45.3c33-8.9 70.7-13.6 112.9-13.6c42.4 0 80.2 4.9 113.5 13.9c11.3-8.6 67.3-48.8 121.3-43.9c2.9 7.7 24.7 58.3 5.5 118c32.4 36.8 48.9 82.7 48.9 132.3c0 102.2-59 188.1-200 212.9a127.5 127.5 0 0 1 38.1 91v112.5c.8 9 0 17.9 15 17.9c177.1-59.7 304.6-227 304.6-424.1c0-247.2-200.4-447.3-447.5-447.3"
    ></path>
  </svg>
</a>
```

### CSS

Here's the CSS code to create the glow effect:

```css
@property --fill {
  syntax: "<percentage>";
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: 0%;
}

.glow {
  position: relative;
  aspect-ratio: 1;
}

.glow:hover {
  color: greenyellow;
  --fill: 100%;
}

.glow::after {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
  content: "";
  inset: -2px;
  border-radius: inherit;
  background: conic-gradient(greenyellow var(--fill), transparent var(--fill));
  transition: --fill 0.6s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Explanation

- I used a custom property `--fill` to control the glow effect.
- The `::after` pseudo-element creates the glow effect using a conic gradient.
- The `hover` state changes the color of the icon and fills the conic gradient to create the glow effect.
