[`rehype-pretty-code`](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) is a versatile Rehype plugin that leverages the [`shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) syntax highlighter to provide visually stunning code blocks in Markdown and MDX files. It works both during the build process on the server sideâ€”eliminating the need for client-side syntax highlightingâ€”and dynamically on the client side when needed.

## Professional-Level Syntax Highlighting

<span className="mix-blend-plus-lighter text-zinc-400/80">
  Experience the precision and detail of VS Code's syntax highlighting directly
  in your Markdown or MDX files, complete with support for the extensive range
  of themes available in the VS Code ecosystem.
</span>

## Line Numbers and Highlighting

Easily draw attention to specific lines in your code, making it clear where to focus.

```js {4} showLineNumbers
import { useFloating } from "@floating-ui/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { refs, floatingStyles } = useFloating();

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={refs.setReference} />
      <div ref={refs.setFloating} style={floatingStyles} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Combining Multiple Features with Meta Strings

Use meta strings to combine multiple features like line numbers, line highlighting, and more, all within a single code block.

```js
function isEven(number) {
  if (number === 1) {
    return false;
  } else if (number === 2) {
    return true;
  } else if (number === 3) {
    return false;
  } else if (number === 4) {
    return true;
  } else if (number === 5) {
    return false;
  } else if (number === 6) {
    return true;
  } else if (number === 7) {
    return false;
  } else if (number === 8) {
    return true;
  } else if (number === 9) {
    return false;
  } else if (number === 10) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return "Number is not between 1 and 10.";
  }
}

// Example usage:
console.log(isEven(3)); // Outputs: false
console.log(isEven(4)); // Outputs: true
console.log(isEven(11)); // Outputs: "Number is not between 1 and 10."
```
